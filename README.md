<h1 align="center">Stephen O'Connor Photography</h1>

 [View the live project here.](https://stephenoc390.github.io/SOCPhotography-Milestone1/)

Stephen O’Connor Photography is a fictional photography website created for my first milestone project in the User-Centric Development module with Code Institute.

The website was created so that the fictional professional photographer can showcase his photography and also inform the user of workshops he offers with the options to enquire about availability and for more details of the workshops, view his social media accounts and a form option to contact him. All images were taken by myself in Tanzania but I am not a photographer or actually based in Tanzania.

## User Experience (UX) 

- ### User Stories
 -  #### First-time Visitor Goals: 
    1. As a first time visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about what it has to offer
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to see images taken by the photographer, learn more about the workshops on offer,  also I want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

  - #### Returning Visitor Goals: 
    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation about booking a photography workshop.

  - #### Frequent Visitor Goals 
    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added images.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   Colour scheme was subtracted from the main image on the home page, using a selection of blues and browns with a white background, I chose white for the background as to not distract the user from the images.
        <img src="assets/readme/colour-theme-1.png" style="margin: 0;">
        <img src="assets/readme/colour-theme-2.png" style="margin: 0;">
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font for content used throughout the website with Sans Serif as a fallback font if the imported fonts do not load. Montserrat is a clean a friendly font which works well to show the website is very welcoming.
        -   The Julius Sans One font is used for al thel headings throughout the website with Sans Serif as a fallback font if the imported fonts do not load. Julius Sans One gives the look of a quite simple font and easy to read but, yet also professional to keep in mind it is a professional photographers page.
        -   The Permanent Marker font is used for just the welcome message on the home page with Sans Serif as a fallback font if the imported fonts do not load. Permanent Marker is quite a fun font that gives the look of uniqueness as would with each owns individual hand writing with a marker, I chose this to give the instant message that these images are unique to this Photographer and it is a friendly website.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   The large, background hero image was used to catch the user's attention straight away and show them what to expect throughout the site with stunning photographs of wildlife. 
        -   On the home page you see 3 images of wildlife to add to the above statement 
        -   On the workshops page you see 3 images this time involving culture to show that the workshops on offer are not just taking photographs of animals but always you will get to learn more about what you are taking photos of.
